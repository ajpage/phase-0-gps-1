#GPS 1.1 Reflection

*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
I had not used fetch and merge prior to this GPS session. Previously I had used pull instead. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
The difference between fetch/merge and pull were clarified along with when there is a merge conflict.
Staging and commiting were also clarified.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
I asked for clarification on the difference between fetch/merge and pull, the syntax for how to delete a branch on git and how to add a colaborator on a project on GitHub.

*What still confuses you about git?*
There are a lot of shortcuts and commands that I am not familiar with still. 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
I enjoyed pairing in a GPS and I really liked both my pair and my guide. I wasn't sure what to expect since it was my first time, but overall it was a good experience. Being able to talk through the steps while using git and GitHub made me feel that much more confortable using both of them.
