What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? : git branch -d "branch-name" was the command I was struggling with before GPS. I could not figure out why I would have duplicate files and then realized after the merge on GitHub, I was not deleting the branch locally.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? : Merging and deleting a branch, as well as merge conflict were clarified. My partner and I realized how hard it was to create a merge conflict, but we now know what to do if ever faced with that situation.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? : When we came up to a statement from the challenge that we were individually confused about we asked our pair for guidance. So there was a lot of going back and forth - great communication. I asked our guide semantics about a step given in the challenge, also how to get rid of the login request when pushing a branch to GitHub.

What still confuses you about git? : I feel pretty confident about git, I just have to  make sure I follow the correct procedure with push and pull requests.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? : It was what I expected - take longer than the time needed so that we both could get familiar with protocol. We both seemed a little nervous (I know I was!), but we communicated well and now have a better understanding of how GPS works.
